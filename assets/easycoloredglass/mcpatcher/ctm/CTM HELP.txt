Make sure that you have set the "EasyColoredGlass" configuration file,
found in "/.minecraft/config/" to the following:


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
# Configuration file

####################
# block
####################

block {
    I:"Colored Glass"=3880
    I:"Colored Glass Pane"=3881
    I:"Colored Sand"=3879
}

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

This texture reskin will NOT work correctly, if you do not have the correct
Block ID values set in both the block properties files, and the mod config
files.

You can edit either the texture properties files to match the Block ID, if
you have mods using Block IDs in the 3879 to 3881 range, or change the Block
IDs in the configuration file.

At present, the "Colored Glass Pane" textures do NOT correctly connect to
each other. This appears to be an issue with how Easy Colored Glass reports
Glass Pane connectivity. You can try creating a "block3881.properties" file,
and adding in the appropriate CTM values, but after three hours of failures,
I've decided to just leave well enough alone, and be happy that the Glass
Blocks connect to each other.

Anyone who wishes to tackle this problem, feel free to, and let me know if
you have better results.
